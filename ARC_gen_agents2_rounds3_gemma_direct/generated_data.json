Each element in the tuple represents a specific position in the permutation order.\n\n3. **Permutation Order:** The key to solving this problem is to understand the order in which the elements should be arranged to achieve the desired output. This order is determined by the permutation of the input elements.\n\n4. **Permutation Operations:** There are several permutation operations that can be performed on the input array to achieve the desired output. These operations can involve swapping elements, inserting or removing elements, or changing their order.\n\n5. **Output Generation:** Once the permutation order is determined, the output array can be generated by applying the specified operations to the input array. This process involves combining elements in a specific order to create the desired output.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n```python\noutput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0"
