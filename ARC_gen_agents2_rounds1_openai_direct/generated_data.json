The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid based on certain rules derived from the demonstrations.\n\nFrom the demonstrations, we can observe the following rules:\n1. The presence of a `5` in any cell of the input grid seems to influence the output grid's corresponding row and column.\n2. The output values are not directly copied from the input; instead, they seem to be determined by the arrangement of `5`s in the input grid.\n\nLet's derive the specific rule based on the demonstrations:\n- When a `5` is present in a row or column, the corresponding output cells in that row or column are filled with numbers that seem to relate to the number of `5`s in that row or column and their positions.\n\nAnalyzing the demonstrations more closely, we can infer the following pattern for determining the output values:\n- The output value for each cell seems to be the count of non-zero numbers in the corresponding row plus the count of non-zero numbers in the corresponding column, minus 1 (to avoid double-counting the cell itself if it contains a `5`).\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test case:\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 5], [5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0]]\n```\n\nFor each cell in the output grid, we calculate the value based on the rule derived:\n- Output[0][0] = count of non-zeros in row 0 + count of non-zeros in column 0 - 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1\n- Output[0][1] = count of non-zeros in row 0 + count of non-zeros in column 1 - 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1\n- Output[0][2] = count of non-zeros in row 0 + count of non-zeros in column 2 - 1 = 1 + 2 - 1 = 2\n- Output[1][0] = count of non-zeros in row 1 + count of non-zeros in column 0 - 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1\n- Output[1][1] = count of non-zeros in row 1 + count of non-zeros in column 1 - 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1\n- Output[1][2] = count of non-zeros in row 1 + count of non-zeros in column 2 - 1 = 1 + 2 - 1 = 2\n- Output[2][0] = count of non-zeros in row 2 + count of non-zeros in column 0 - 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1\n- Output[2][1] = count of non-zeros in row 2 + count of non-zeros in column 1 - 1 = 1 + 2 - 1 = 2\n- Output[2][2] = count of non-zeros in row 2 + count of non-zeros in column 2 - 1 = 1 + 2 - 1 = 2\n\nThus, the output grid based on the derived rule is:\n```\noutput = [[1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2]]\n```\n\nThis output is calculated based on the observed pattern and the rule derived from the demonstrations."

Leave `1`s that are isolated or part of a specific pattern that should not change based on the demonstrations.\n\nApplying this logic to the test case input:\n\n```\ninput = [\n[1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1],\n[1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1],\n[1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1],\n[1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9]\n]\n```\n\nTransforming the `1`s to `8`s according to the rule:\n\n```\noutput = [\n[8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 8],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n[8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 8],\n[8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8],\n[8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8],\n[8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9],\n[9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9]\n]\n```\n\nThis output is derived by applying the observed transformation rule to the test case input."

                    "content": "To solve the given abstraction and reasoning problem, let's analyze the pattern from the demonstration tasks and apply it to the test case.\n\nFrom the demonstrations, it seems that the transformation from input to output involves the following rules:\n1. **Preserve the structure of the original grid**: The overall layout and the positions of the numbers and colors remain the same.\n2. **Substitute specific numbers/colors with a sequence or pattern**: Where there's a specific number (other than the primary color/number, which seems to be `8`), it's replaced or modified according to a certain sequence or pattern.\n\nGiven the test case, we notice that `8` is the primary number, and there are sequences involving `4` and `3`. In the demonstrations, numbers like `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` are transformed into sequences that seem to alternate or follow a specific pattern around their occurrence.\n\nFor the test case, we'll apply a similar reasoning:\n- If `4` and `3` are part of a sequence, we should look for a pattern around them. In the demonstrations, sequences often involve alternating numbers or repeating patterns around special numbers.\n- Since the input doesn't directly show a clear sequence for transformation, we'll maintain the structure and apply a simple transformation rule based on the demonstrations.\n\nGiven the complexity and the abstract nature of the demonstrations, without a clear, explicit rule for every possible number transformation, we'll focus on the specific numbers present (`4` and `3`) and apply a straightforward transformation based on their presence.\n\nIn the demonstrations, sequences involving numbers often alternate or increase/decrease. However, without a clear sequence to follow from the demonstrations for these specific numbers, we'll maintain them as they are, assuming they might indicate a special condition or transformation that isn't fully explained by the provided examples.\n\nThus, for the test case, since we don't have a clear, explicit transformation rule for `4` and `3` based on the demonstrations (other than their special treatment), we'll output the grid with these numbers preserved, assuming they're special markers or conditions that don't change.\n\nTherefore, the output for the test case will be the same as the input, as we don't have enough information to apply a specific transformation to `4` and `3`:\n\n```\noutput = [[8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8], [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8], [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8], [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nThis solution assumes that the presence of `4` and `3` does not alter the surrounding numbers in a way that was clearly defined by the demonstrations."

From the provided demonstrations, it seems that the transformation from input to output involves replacing certain numbers with a sequence or pattern based on their surroundings or position in the grid.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern observed in the demonstrations:\n\n1. **Numbers Replacement**: It appears that specific numbers in the grid are replaced with a sequence of numbers. For example, in the first demonstration, the number `3` and `2` seem to replace certain `8`s or `0`s in a patterned manner, possibly based on their positions or surrounding numbers.\n\n2. **Pattern Repetition**: The sequence of numbers (like `3, 2, 3, 2...` or `1, 4, 1, 4...`) repeats in certain areas, especially around the `8`s which seem to act as boundaries or markers for where the pattern should be applied.\n\nGiven these observations, let's apply the reasoning to the test case. The test case input does not explicitly show where `3`, `2`, `1`, or `4` should be placed based on the demonstrations because the demonstrations themselves are complex and don't provide a simple rule for every possible configuration of numbers. However, we can infer that the sequence or pattern of numbers should be applied around or near the `8`s, and possibly in relation to the `4` and `3` present in the input.\n\nGiven the complexity and the abstract nature of the pattern, without a clear, straightforward rule from the demonstrations, we'll apply a generalized understanding based on observed patterns:\n\n- `8`s often remain unchanged.\n- Sequences like `3, 2, 3, 2...` or `1, 4, 1, 4...` are introduced in areas adjacent to `8`s or as replacements for sequences of `0`s.\n- The presence of `4` and `3` in the input might indicate starting points for sequences.\n\nFor the test case, we notice there are `4` and `3` present, which could be starting points for sequences. However, without a clear rule on how to propagate these sequences (vertically, horizontally, or both), and considering the complexity of creating a precise output without explicit instructions, we can only hypothesize about the general approach to generating the output.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for a specific rule to accurately generate the output, it's challenging to provide an exact output without further clarification on the rules for number replacement and sequence generation. \n\nIf you have more specific rules or patterns observed that should be applied, please provide them, and I will be able to give a more accurate solution based on those rules."

The demonstrations show a transformation of a larger grid with specific patterns of colored cells (denoted by numbers, with 0 representing an uncolored cell and other numbers representing different colors) into a smaller grid with a different arrangement of colors.\n\nFrom the demonstrations, we can observe the following rules:\n1. The output grid size is smaller than the input grid, specifically 9x9 cells.\n2. The arrangement of colors in the output grid seems to follow a specific pattern based on the arrangement of colors in the input grid.\n3. The color patterns in the input are transformed and condensed into a smaller representation in the output.\n\nGiven these observations, let's apply these rules to the test case input to derive the output.\n\nTest case input analysis:\n- The input grid has a central horizontal band of colored cells (5s) spanning 9 cells in width, similar to the demonstrations.\n- There are three rows of this band, followed by three rows with a gap in the middle, and then another three rows of a band with a gap in the middle but shifted to the right.\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the demonstrations, the output grid will likely represent these bands and gaps in a condensed form, maintaining the relative positions and shapes of the colored areas.\n\nGiven the specific arrangement in the test case, where we have a central band, gaps, and shifted bands, the output should reflect this structure in a 9x9 grid. The transformation rules observed in the demonstrations suggest that the output will condense these patterns into a smaller representation, maintaining the essence of the pattern.\n\nTherefore, the output for the test case, following the observed transformation rules and applying them to the specific patterns in the test case input, is:\n\n```\noutput = [[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], \n          [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5], \n          [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5], \n          [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], \n          [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5], \n          [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5], \n          [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]]\n```\n\nThis output reflects the central band of colors, the gaps, and the shifted bands, condensed into a 9x9 representation following the transformation rules observed in the demonstrations."

The pattern involves transforming a grid of zeros and fives into a smaller grid with a specific arrangement of fives and zeros. The transformation seems to follow a particular logic based on the arrangement of fives in the input grid.\n\nFrom the demonstrations, we can observe that the output grid is a condensed version of the input grid, where clusters of fives in the input are represented as smaller patterns of fives and zeros in the output. The specific arrangement of these clusters in the output seems to mirror the arrangement in the input but in a more compact form.\n\nGiven the test case input:\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nWe can see a large cluster of fives in the middle of the grid, surrounded by zeros, with a smaller cluster of fives below it, and another cluster to the right. This arrangement should be reflected in the output grid in a condensed form.\n\nBased on the pattern observed in the demonstrations, the output for the test case should be:\n```\noutput = [[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]]\n```\n\nThis output reflects the condensed version of the input grid, maintaining the arrangement and proportion of clusters of fives and zeros."

Upon closer inspection, the rule seems to be related to the configuration of `1`s in the input grid:\n   - If a `1` is part of a horizontal or vertical line of three `1`s, it is changed to `2` in the output.\n   - Diagonal lines or isolated `1`s do not trigger the change to `2`.\n\n2. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**: We will apply this observed rule to the test case input grid to generate the output grid.\n\nGiven the test case input:\n```\ninput = [\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n]\n```\n\nWe will transform this input into the output by applying the rule:\n\n- Rows 2, 3, 5, 8, and 10 contain horizontal lines of three `1`s, so these `1`s will be changed to `2`s.\n- Column 8 contains a vertical line of three `1`s at the bottom, so these `1`s will also be changed to `2`s.\n\nApplying these rules, we get the output:\n```\noutput = [\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2],\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n]\n```\n\nThis output grid follows the transformation rules observed from the demonstration examples and applies them to the test case input."

The output grid is always 4x3.\n2. The value `3` in the output seems to represent a significant pattern or condition found in the input grid. Specifically, it appears to relate to the presence of certain numbers in specific positions within each row of the input grid.\n3. The presence of `1` and `5` in specific positions within the input grid seems to influence where `3` or `0` appears in the output grid.\n\nLet's deduce the rules based on the input and output patterns:\n\n- The `1` in the input grid is always in the fourth position of each row, serving as a constant reference point.\n- The presence of `7` and `5` in relation to the position of `1` seems to dictate the placement of `3` in the output grid:\n  - If `7` is present before `1` and `5` is present after `1`, it seems to correspond to a `3` in the output grid.\n  - The specific position of `3` in the output grid appears to be influenced by the arrangement of `7` and `5` around `1` in the input grid.\n\nGiven these observations, let's apply the rules to the test case:\n\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0], [7, 7, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5]]\n```\n\nFor each row in the input, we determine the presence of `3` in the output:\n\n1. First row: `1` is followed by a `5` without any `7` before it, so `3` is placed in the last column.\n2. Second row: `1` is followed by `5` and has `7` before it, so `3` is placed in the middle column.\n3. Third row: `1` is followed by a `5` without any `7` before it, so `3` is placed in the last column.\n4.

The task involves transforming a 4x7 input grid into a 4x3 output grid based on certain rules that we need to deduce from the demonstrations.\n\nObserving the demonstrations, we can notice the following patterns:\n1. The output grid size is consistently 4x3, regardless of the input.\n2. The transformation seems to depend on the presence of certain values in specific columns of the input grid.\n\nLet's break down the rules based on the input and output patterns:\n- The first column of the output seems to be always filled with zeros, which suggests that it might not depend on the input or the rule for this column is consistent across all cases.\n- The second and third columns in the output grid seem to depend on the presence of certain numbers in the input grid. Specifically, these numbers are 7, 1, and 5, which are present in all input grids.\n- The presence of '7' in the first three columns of the input grid seems to influence the second column of the output grid.\n- The presence of '5' in the last four columns of the input grid seems to influence the third column of the output grid.\n- The number '3' in the output grid seems to indicate the presence of the numbers '7' or '5' according to the rules above, while '0' indicates their absence in the relevant sections of the input grid.\n\nBased on these observations, let's deduce the rules:\n- For each row in the output grid:\n  - The first column is always 0.\n  - The second column is 3 if there is at least one '7' in the first three columns of the corresponding input row; otherwise, it is 0.\n  - The third column is 3 if there is at least one '5' in the last four columns of the corresponding input row; otherwise, it is 0.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the test case:\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0], [7, 7, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5]]\n```\n\nFor each row:\n1. No '7' in the first three columns, but there is a '5' in the last four columns -> [0, 0, 3]\n2. There are '7's in the first three columns, and there are '5's in the last four columns -> [0, 3, 3]\n3. No '7' in the first three columns, but there is a '5' in the last four columns -> [0, 0, 3]\n4. There is a '7' in the first three columns, and there are '5's in the last four columns -> [0, 3, 3]\n\nTherefore, the output for the test case is:\n```\noutput = [[0, 0, 3], [0, 3, 3], [0, 0, 3], [0, 3, 3]]\n```"

From the demonstrations, we can observe the following rules:\n\n1. **Mirroring and Expansion**: Certain patterns are mirrored and expanded across different axes. For example, a pattern on one side of the grid may be mirrored or expanded on another side.\n2. **Color/Number Propagation**: Specific numbers/colors propagate or expand in certain directions, often filling in adjacent or specific patterns.\n\nGiven these observations, let's apply these rules to the test case:\n\n- The pattern of `8`s in the input seems to expand and fill adjacent spaces in the output. In the demonstrations, `8`s tend to fill horizontally adjacent cells.\n- The `4` and `3` pattern observed in the input suggests a mirroring or expansion, as seen in the demonstrations.\n- The `2`s and `1`s seem to propagate or expand in specific patterns, often filling in lines or creating mirrored patterns.\n\nApplying these rules to the test case:\n\n1. The `8`s in the fourth and fifth rows will expand to fill adjacent spaces.\n2. The `4` and `3` pattern in the seventh row suggests a mirroring or expansion, similar to the demonstrations.\n3.

The pattern involves transforming specific shapes and colors in the input grid to a different arrangement or color in the output grid. Let's analyze the pattern based on the demonstrations provided:\n\n1. **Square Patterns**: Squares or rectangles in the input are transformed in a specific way in the output. For example, a square of `8`s might be expanded or mirrored.\n2. **Line Patterns**: Lines or sequences of the same number might be extended, mirrored, or both.\n3. **Single Digits**: Individual numbers might be transformed into a different number or a pattern of numbers in the output.\n\nGiven these observations, let's apply the pattern to the test case:\n\n1. The square of `8`s in the input is mirrored vertically and horizontally.\n2. The line of `2`s is extended to form a square in the output.\n3. The `3` and `4` patterns are mirrored or extended based on their positions relative to other numbers.\n\nApplying these rules to the test case:\n\n- The square of `8`s in rows 4-5 and columns 5-6 is mirrored to the right and below.\n- The `2`s in row 6, columns 8-9, create a square in the output.\n- The `3` and `4` patterns are extended or mirrored based on their positions.\n\nGiven the complexity of the pattern and the need for precise transformations, let's apply these rules to generate the output for the test case:\n\n```\noutput = [\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nThis output is based on the observed patterns and transformations from the demonstration tasks.

The pattern involves identifying cells adjacent to the cells with the value '8' and changing these adjacent cells' values to '1'. It's important to note that 'adjacent' in this context means horizontally or vertically adjacent, not diagonally.\n\nLet's apply this pattern to the test case:\n\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], \n         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], \n         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], \n         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nFollowing the pattern, we will change the cells adjacent to '8' to '1', except for cells that already contain '8':\n\n1. The first row has '8's at positions 5 and 6. The cell before position 5 changes to '1'.\n2. The second row has '8's at positions 0, 1, and 6. The cells adjacent to these positions change to '1', except for those already containing '8'.\n3. The third row has an '8' at position 0. The cell adjacent to it changes to '1'.\n4. The fourth row has an '8' at position 3. The cells adjacent to it change to '1', except for those already containing '8'.\n5. The fifth row has '8's at positions 3 and 4. The cells adjacent to these positions change to '1', except for those already containing '8'.\n6. The sixth row has an '8' at position 1. The cells adjacent to it change to '1'.\n7.

The pattern involves identifying the positions of the number 8 in the input grid and then modifying certain cells based on a specific rule.\n\nFrom the demonstrations, we can observe the following rule:\n- For each cell that contains the number 8, if the cell directly to its right also contains the number 8, then the cell directly below the leftmost 8 of this pair is changed to 1 in the output grid. If the cell directly below the rightmost 8 of the pair is empty (contains 0), it is also changed to 1.\n\nApplying this rule to the test case:\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], \n         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], \n         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], \n         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nLet's apply the rule:\n- The first pair of 8s is at (0, 5) and (0, 6). The cell directly below the leftmost 8 (at position (1, 5)) is changed to 1.\n- The second pair of 8s is at (4, 3) and (4, 4). The cell directly below the leftmost 8 (at position (5, 3)) is changed to 1.\n- The third pair of 8s is at (6, 0) and (6, 1). The cell directly below the leftmost 8 (at position (7, 0)) does not exist, so no change is made here.\n\nTherefore, the output grid will be:\n```\noutput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], \n          [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8], \n          [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], \n          [0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], \n          [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nThis output follows the observed rule from the demonstration examples and applies it to the test case provided."

                    "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern from the demonstration examples and apply it to the test case. From the demonstrations, we can observe that:\n\n1. The number `5` in the input grid is converted to different numbers in the output grid based on its position and grouping.\n2. Each distinct group or pattern of `5`s in the input grid is assigned a unique number in the output grid, starting from `1` and increasing with each different pattern.\n3. The numbers in the output grid seem to represent different clusters or shapes formed by the `5`s in the input grid, with each unique shape being assigned a different number.\n\nGiven these observations, let's apply this pattern to the test case:\n\nInput grid:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],\n [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5],\n [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nTo generate the output, we identify and number each unique cluster of `5`s:\n\n1. The single `5`s on the right side of the grid form one pattern.\n2. The two `5`s together on the top right form another pattern.\n3. The four `5`s together in a square shape form a third pattern.\n4. The single `5` on the bottom left forms a fourth pattern.\n5. The three `5`s together in a line form a fifth pattern.\n\nApplying these rules to the test case:\n\nOutput grid:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1],\n [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the pattern, it seems there was an oversight in the description of the last two patterns. The correct interpretation should maintain the consistency of numbering unique shapes without introducing a new number for a pattern that matches an existing one. Given the established patterns, the correct output should not introduce a \"5\" as a new pattern identifier since we are incrementing from 1 for each unique shape of \"5\" clusters in the input. Let's correct this oversight:\n\nCorrected Output grid:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1],\n [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nThis corrected output accurately reflects the assignment of numbers to unique clusters of `5`s from the input grid, adhering to the observed pattern from the demonstrations."

The transformation from the input grid to the output grid seems to be based on the following rules:\n\n1. Each `5` in the input grid is transformed into a different number in the output grid based on its position or configuration.\n2. The transformation rules can be inferred as follows:\n   - If a `5` is isolated (not adjacent to another `5`), it transforms into `1`.\n   - If a `5` is part of a horizontal pair, it transforms into `2`.\n   - If a `5` is part of a vertical pair, it transforms into `3`.\n   - If a `5` is part of a 2x2 square, each `5` in that square transforms into `4`.\n\nGiven these rules, let's apply them to the test case:\n\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], \n         [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5], \n         [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], \n         [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nApplying the transformation rules:\n\n- The `5`s at the rightmost column form a vertical pair, so they transform into `3`.\n- The `5`s in the second row from the bottom form a horizontal pair, so they transform into `2`.\n- The `5`s in the third row form two horizontal pairs, so they transform into `2`.\n- The `5`s in the fourth row from the top form two horizontal pairs, so they transform into `2`.\n- The isolated `5`s transform into `1`.\n\nThus, the output grid will be:\n\n```\noutput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], \n          [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3], \n          [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], \n          [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```"
