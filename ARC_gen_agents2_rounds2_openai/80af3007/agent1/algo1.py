    # the observed patterns in the demonstrations.
    # Note: This is a simplification and may not accurately reflect the intended transformation.

    # and possibly apply different transformations to other clusters.
    # This example does not implement that logic but provides a starting point.

    # to mimic a possible pattern based on the demonstrations.
