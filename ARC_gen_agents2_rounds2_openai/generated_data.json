Here's an updated version of the solution that incorporates these considerations:\n\n```python\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    # Copy the input grid to the output grid.\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n\n    # Function to check if a cell should be transformed to 8.\n    def should_transform_to_8(r, c):\n        transform = False\n        # Check horizontally\n        if c > 0 and c < cols - 1:\n            if input_grid[r][c - 1] == 1 and input_grid[r][c + 1] == 1:\n                transform = True\n        # Check vertically\n        if r > 0 and r < rows - 1:\n            if input_grid[r - 1][c] == 1 and input_grid[r + 1][c] == 1:\n                transform = True\n        return transform\n\n    # Iterate through the grid and apply the transformation rules.\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r][c] == 1:\n                if should_transform_to_8(r, c):\n                    output_grid[r][c] = 8\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test case\ninput_grid = [\n    [1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1],\n    [1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1],\n    [1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9]\n]\n\noutput_grid = solve(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis updated solution checks each `1` in the input grid to determine if it is part of a horizontal or vertical line of at least two `1`s. If it is, the function transforms it into an `8`. This approach ensures that only the `1`s that are part of such lines are transformed, while isolated `1`s or those forming part of a square or rectangle remain unchanged."

Specifically, `1`s that are part of a contiguous block (horizontally or vertically) are changed to `8`s, but isolated `1`s or those that form a specific pattern (like a line or a square) remain unchanged.\n\nHere's a Python function that implements this logic:\n\n```python\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    # Copy the input grid to the output grid\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n\n    # Function to check if a cell is within the grid bounds\n    def in_bounds(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    # Function to recursively fill contiguous '1's with '8's\n    def fill(r, c):\n        if not in_bounds(r, c) or input_grid[r][c] != 1:\n            return\n        output_grid[r][c] = 8\n        for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n            fill(r + dr, c + dc)\n\n    # Iterate over the grid and apply the fill function to each '1' found\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r][c] == 1 and output_grid[r][c] != 8:\n                # Check if the current '1' is part of a larger block\n                is_part_of_block = False\n                for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                    if in_bounds(nr, nc) and input_grid[nr][nc] == 1:\n                        is_part_of_block = True\n                        break\n                if is_part_of_block:\n                    fill(r, c)\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test case\ninput_grid = [\n    [1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1],\n    [1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1],\n    [1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9]\n]\n\noutput_grid = solve(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code defines a `solve` function that takes an input grid, identifies contiguous blocks of `1`s, and changes those `1`s to `8`s, leaving the rest of the grid unchanged.

This solution will focus on identifying sequences surrounding the numbers 3, 4, and replacing or inserting sequences based on the observed patterns in the demonstrations.\n\nLet's attempt to write a Python function that applies these inferred rules to solve the test case:\n\n```python\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions and values as the input grid\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]\n    \n    # Define the sequence patterns observed in the demonstration\n    pattern_3 = [2, 3]  # Assuming a pattern based on the presence of '3'\n    pattern_4 = [1, 4]  # Assuming a pattern based on the presence of '4'\n    \n    # Iterate through the grid to apply transformations based on the patterns\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):\n            # Check for the presence of '3' and apply the corresponding pattern\n            if input_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                for k, val in enumerate(pattern_3):\n                    if j + k + 1 < len(input_grid[0]):  # Ensure we don't go out of bounds\n                        output_grid[i][j + k + 1] = val\n            \n            # Check for the presence of '4' and apply the corresponding pattern\n            elif input_grid[i][j] == 4:\n                for k, val in enumerate(pattern_4):\n                    if j + k + 1 < len(input_grid[0]):  # Ensure we don't go out of bounds\n                        output_grid[i][j + k + 1] = val\n    \n    # Return the transformed output grid\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test case\ninput_grid = [\n    [8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n    # ... remaining rows\n]\n\noutput_grid = solve(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code attempts to apply inferred rules based on the presence of numbers '3' and '4' in the input grid, applying specific sequences next to these numbers. Note that this solution is based on assumptions and observed patterns from the provided demonstrations, and may not fully capture the intended transformation rules without more explicit instructions or examples."

One noticeable pattern is the presence of sequences of numbers (e.g., 1, 4, 1, 4 or 2, 3, 2, 3) replacing certain numbers or sequences in the input grid. It seems like these sequences are inserted in specific positions, possibly related to the presence of certain numbers (like 8) or patterns in the input grid.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for specific rule identification, which is not explicitly provided, we will make an assumption based on observed patterns and attempt to apply it to the test case. This solution will focus on identifying sequences surrounding the numbers 3, 4, and replacing or inserting sequences based on the observed patterns in the demonstrations.\n\nLet's attempt to write a Python function that applies these inferred rules to solve the test case:\n\n```python\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions and values as the input grid\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]\n    \n    # Define the sequence patterns observed in the demonstration\n    pattern_3 = [2, 3]  # Assuming a pattern based on the presence of '3'\n    pattern_4 = [1, 4]  # Assuming a pattern based on the presence of '4'\n    \n    # Iterate through the grid to apply transformations based on the patterns\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):\n            # Check for the presence of '3' and apply the corresponding pattern\n            if input_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                for k, val in enumerate(pattern_3):\n                    if j + k + 1 < len(input_grid[0]):  # Ensure we don't go out of bounds\n                        output_grid[i][j + k + 1] = val\n            \n            # Check for the presence of '4' and apply the corresponding pattern\n            elif input_grid[i][j] == 4:\n                for k, val in enumerate(pattern_4):\n                    if j + k + 1 < len(input_grid[0]):  # Ensure we don't go out of bounds\n                        output_grid[i][j + k + 1] = val\n    \n    # Return the transformed output grid\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test case\ninput_grid = [\n    [8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n    # ... remaining rows\n]\n\noutput_grid = solve(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code attempts to apply inferred rules based on the presence of numbers '3' and '4' in the input grid, applying specific sequences next to these numbers. Note that this solution is based on assumptions and observed patterns from the provided demonstrations, and may not fully capture the intended transformation rules without more explicit instructions or examples.```\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.

However, without explicit instructions on how to transform the input clusters, we'll focus on a general approach that could be adapted once the transformation rules are better understood.\n\nHere's a Python function that implements this strategy, assuming a transformation rule needs to be applied:\n\n```python\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    # Placeholder for the output grid, assuming we need to determine its size dynamically\n    output_grid = []\n\n    # Example transformation rule (to be adapted based on actual pattern logic)\n    # This is a placeholder logic and should be replaced with the actual transformation rules\n    # inferred from the demonstration tasks.\n    def transform_cluster(cluster):\n        # Placeholder transformation: simply returns a 3x3 grid with the cluster value\n        return [[cluster[0][0] for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n\n    # Identify clusters in the input grid\n    # This is a simplified approach; actual implementation may require more complex logic\n    # to identify and separate clusters correctly.\n    clusters = []  # This would be a list of clusters found in the input grid\n    for row in input_grid:\n        for value in row:\n            if value != 0:\n                # Assuming a very simple cluster identification for demonstration\n                clusters.append([[value]])\n\n    # Transform each cluster and add to the output grid\n    # This is a placeholder loop; the actual logic will depend on how clusters are identified\n    # and how they should be transformed based on the task requirements.\n    for cluster in clusters:\n        transformed_cluster = transform_cluster(cluster)\n        output_grid.extend(transformed_cluster)  # This is a placeholder operation\n\n    # Return the transformed output grid\n    # This output grid is based on placeholder logic and should be adapted\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test case (placeholder; should be replaced with actual test case input)\ntest_input = [\n    # This should be replaced with the actual input grid from the test case\n]\n\n# Solve the test case (this call is illustrative and needs the actual test case input to work)\noutput = solve(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code provides a scaffold for solving the problem based on identifying clusters and applying a transformation rule. However, the specific logic for identifying clusters and the exact transformation rule need to be derived from the demonstration tasks and then implemented in the function."

From the demonstrations, it seems that the task involves identifying clusters of non-zero elements (in this case, the number 5) in the input grid and then transforming these clusters into a specific pattern in the output grid. The transformation rules need to be inferred from the provided demonstrations.\n\nLet's outline a strategy to solve this problem:\n1. Identify clusters of non-zero elements in the input grid.\n2. Determine the transformation rule based on the demonstrations.\n3. Apply the transformation rule to each cluster to generate the output grid.\n\nGiven the complexity of the transformation, it appears that the output pattern is not a simple replication or rotation of the input clusters but involves a more intricate mapping. However, without explicit instructions on how to transform the input clusters, we'll focus on a general approach that could be adapted once the transformation rules are better understood.\n\nHere's a Python function that implements this strategy, assuming a transformation rule needs to be applied:\n\n```python\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    # Placeholder for the output grid, assuming we need to determine its size dynamically\n    output_grid = []\n\n    # Example transformation rule (to be adapted based on actual pattern logic)\n    # This is a placeholder logic and should be replaced with the actual transformation rules\n    # inferred from the demonstration tasks.\n    def transform_cluster(cluster):\n        # Placeholder transformation: simply returns a 3x3 grid with the cluster value\n        return [[cluster[0][0] for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n\n    # Identify clusters in the input grid\n    # This is a simplified approach; actual implementation may require more complex logic\n    # to identify and separate clusters correctly.\n    clusters = []  # This would be a list of clusters found in the input grid\n    for row in input_grid:\n        for value in row:\n            if value != 0:\n                # Assuming a very simple cluster identification for demonstration\n                clusters.append([[value]])\n\n    # Transform each cluster and add to the output grid\n    # This is a placeholder loop; the actual logic will depend on how clusters are identified\n    # and how they should be transformed based on the task requirements.\n    for cluster in clusters:\n        transformed_cluster = transform_cluster(cluster)\n        output_grid.extend(transformed_cluster)  # This is a placeholder operation\n\n    # Return the transformed output grid\n    # This output grid is based on placeholder logic and should be adapted\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test case (placeholder; should be replaced with actual test case input)\ntest_input = [\n    # This should be replaced with the actual input grid from the test case\n]\n\n# Solve the test case (this call is illustrative and needs the actual test case input to work)\noutput = solve(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code provides a scaffold for solving the problem based on identifying clusters and applying a transformation rule. However, the specific logic for identifying clusters and the exact transformation rule need to be derived from the demonstration tasks and then implemented in the function.```\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.

A key observation is that the output grid size and the arrangement of `5`s within it seem to be consistent with certain characteristics of the input clusters.\n\nGiven this understanding, let's attempt to write a Python function that applies a generalized approach to solving the test case, based on the assumption that we need to identify clusters of `5`s and transform them according to a pattern inferred from the demonstrations.\n\n```python\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    # Initialize an empty output grid of size 9x9, based on observed output sizes.\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Based on the demonstrations, it seems that the transformation involves\n    # creating patterns from the clusters of '5's in the input grid.\n    # For simplicity, we'll assume a specific pattern transformation that needs\n    # to be adapted according to the actual rules inferred from the demonstrations.\n    \n    # This is a placeholder for the logic to identify clusters and their transformations.\n    # The actual implementation would depend on the specific transformation rules,\n    # which are not explicitly provided.\n    \n    # For the given test case, let's apply a hypothetical transformation based on\n    # the observed patterns in the demonstrations.\n    # Note: This is a simplification and may not accurately reflect the intended transformation.\n    \n    # Example: Transform the largest cluster of '5's into a specific pattern,\n    # and possibly apply different transformations to other clusters.\n    # This example does not implement that logic but provides a starting point.\n    \n    # Placeholder transformation: Fill the center of the output grid with '5's\n    # to mimic a possible pattern based on the demonstrations.\n    for i in range(4, 5):\n        for j in range(4, 5):\n            output_grid[i][j] = 5\n    \n    # Return the transformed output grid\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test case\ntest_input = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Solve the test case\noutput_test = solve(test_input)\nfor row in output_test:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code attempts to provide a solution based on the understanding that the output grid is a transformed version of the input grid, focusing on clusters of `5`s.

Further analysis and more detailed instructions would be necessary to accurately implement the transformation rules."

From the provided demonstrations, it seems that the task involves transforming clusters of `1`s in the input grid into `2`s in the output grid under certain conditions, while keeping the rest of the grid unchanged.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1. Identify clusters of `1`s in the input grid. A cluster is defined as a group of adjacent `1`s horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).\n2. For each cluster of `1`s, determine if it should be transformed into `2`s based on the pattern observed in the demonstrations.\n3. Create the output grid by copying the input grid and applying the transformations determined in step 2.\n4. Return the output grid.\n\nThe pattern from the demonstrations seems to be:\n- A cluster of `1`s is transformed into `2`s if it forms a horizontal or vertical line of at least three `1`s.\n\nLet's implement this solution:\n\n```python\ndef find_clusters(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    visited = set()\n    clusters = []\n\n    def dfs(r, c):\n        if (r, c) in visited or grid[r][c] != 1:\n            return []\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        cluster = [(r, c)]\n        for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                cluster.extend(dfs(nr, nc))\n        return cluster\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 1 and (r, c) not in visited:\n                cluster = dfs(r, c)\n                if cluster:  # Only consider non-empty clusters\n                    clusters.append(cluster)\n    return clusters\n\ndef should_transform(cluster):\n    rows = set(x[0] for x in cluster)\n    cols = set(x[1] for x in cluster)\n    return len(cluster) >= 3 and (len(rows) == 1 or len(cols) == 1)\n\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    clusters = find_clusters(input_grid)\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]  # Make a deep copy of the input grid\n\n    for cluster in clusters:\n        if should_transform(cluster):\n            for r, c in cluster:\n                output_grid[r][c] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test case\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n]\n\noutput_grid = solve(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `solve` that takes an input grid, identifies clusters of `1`s, determines which clusters should be transformed based on the observed pattern, and then creates and returns the output grid with the transformations applied.```\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.

This rule simplifies the problem significantly, as we don't need to identify clusters in a general sense but only need to check for lines of `1`s.\n\nWe can implement this solution efficiently by iterating over each cell in the input grid and checking its neighbors horizontally and vertically.

A closed shape is defined as an area where `5`s completely surround `0`s, either in a straight line or around the corners.\n\nLet's write a Python function that applies this rule to the input grid and produces the correct output grid.\n\n```python\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    # Copy the input grid to avoid modifying it directly\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]\n    \n    # Function to check if a cell is surrounded by 5s\n    def is_surrounded_by_5s(x, y):\n        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if nx < 0 or nx >= len(input_grid) or ny < 0 or ny >= len(input_grid[0]) or input_grid[nx][ny] != 5:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    # Iterate through the grid and apply the transformation rule\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):\n            if input_grid[i][j] == 0 and is_surrounded_by_5s(i, j):\n                output_grid[i][j] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test case\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], \n    [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0], \n    [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], \n    [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], \n    [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], \n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\noutput_grid = solve(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `solve` that takes an input grid, applies the transformation rule based on the pattern observed in the demonstrations, and returns the output grid.

The pattern involves expanding certain elements in the grid and transforming them according to specific rules. Here's a breakdown of the observed rules:\n\n1. **Expansion of Elements**: Certain elements (numbers) in the grid seem to expand or transform in a specific manner. For example, numbers like 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 transform into patterns that spread across their neighboring cells.\n2. **Transformation Rules**:\n   - The number **2** expands horizontally and vertically to adjacent cells.\n   - The number **3** transforms into a larger block of 3s, expanding horizontally.\n   - The number **4** expands into a larger block, similar to 3 but with a different arrangement.\n   - The number **6** expands horizontally.\n   - The number **8** expands into a larger block, filling all adjacent cells around it.\n\nGiven these rules, we can write a Python function to apply these transformations to the input grid and produce the output grid.

The pattern involves transforming specific elements in the input grid to produce the output grid. Let's break down the observed patterns:\n\n1. **Mirroring and Expansion**: Certain elements in the input grid are mirrored or expanded in the output grid. For example, a single element might be mirrored to form a pair in the output, or a pair might expand to form a larger structure.\n\n2. **Color/Number Transformations**: Specific numbers (representing colors) in the input grid are transformed into different numbers in the output grid, often expanding or shifting their positions.\n\n3. **Preservation of Certain Structures**: Some structures or patterns in the input grid are preserved in the output grid, either in their original form or with some transformation applied.\n\nGiven these observations, the solution involves iterating over the input grid, identifying the patterns or structures that need to be transformed according to the rules observed in the demonstrations, and constructing the output grid accordingly.\n\nHere's a Python function that implements the solution based on the observed patterns:\n\n```python\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(len(input_grid[0]))] for _ in range(len(input_grid))]\n    \n    # Iterate over the input grid to apply transformations\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):\n            # Apply transformations based on observed patterns from the demonstrations\n            # This is a placeholder for the specific logic based on the patterns you've identified\n            # For example, mirroring, expanding, or transforming numbers/colors\n            \n            # Direct copy for demonstration; replace with actual logic\n            output_grid[i][j] = input_grid[i][j]\n            \n            # Example transformation: Mirror elements horizontally in a specific row\n            # This is just an illustrative example and may not apply directly to the problem\n            if i == 5:  # Assuming we want to mirror elements in the 6th row\n                if j < len(input_grid[0]) // 2:\n                    output_grid[i][len(input_grid[0]) - 1 - j] = input_grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Return the transformed output grid\n    return output_grid\n\n# Example test case (replace with actual test case)\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    # Add the rest of the input grid rows here\n]\n\n# Solve the test case\noutput_grid = solve(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code provides a basic structure for solving the problem. You need to fill in the specific logic for transforming the input grid based on the patterns you observe in the demonstration examples. The example transformation provided in the code is illustrative and should be replaced with the actual logic that matches the patterns from the demonstrations.```\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.

We'll implement a Python function that checks for these numbers in the input grid and applies the corresponding transformations based on the patterns observed in the demonstration examples.\n\n```python\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(len(input_grid[0]))] for _ in range(len(input_grid))]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules for each number.\n    transformations = {\n        2: [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)],  # Horizontal and vertical expansion\n        3: [(0, 1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)],  # Horizontal expansion\n        4: [(0, 1), (1, 0)],  # Block expansion\n        6: [(0, 1)],  # Horizontal expansion\n        8: [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (-1, -1), (1, -1), (-1, 1)]  # Full surrounding expansion\n    }\n    \n    # Function to apply transformations based on the cell's value.\n    def apply_transformations(x, y, value):\n        if value in transformations:\n            for dx, dy in transformations[value]:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if 0 <= nx < len(output_grid) and 0 <= ny < len(output_grid[0]):\n                    output_grid[nx][ny] = value\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid and apply transformations.\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):\n            cell_value = input_grid[i][j]\n            # Copy the original value to the output grid.\n            output_grid[i][j] = cell_value\n            # Apply transformations if the cell contains a transformable value.\n            if cell_value in transformations:\n                apply_transformations(i, j, cell_value)\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test case\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    # Add the rest of the input grid rows here as per the test case provided\n]\n\n# Solve the test case\noutput_grid = solve(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis solution applies the specific transformation rules based on the observed patterns from the demonstration examples. It iterates through each cell in the input grid, checks if the cell contains a number that requires transformation, and applies the corresponding transformations to produce the output grid."

The pattern involves transforming specific elements in the input grid to produce the output grid. Let's break down the observed patterns:\n\n1. **Mirroring and Expansion**: Certain elements in the input grid are mirrored or expanded in the output grid. For example, a single element might be mirrored to form a pair in the output, or a pair might expand to form a larger structure.\n\n2. **Color/Number Transformations**: Specific numbers (representing colors) in the input grid are transformed into different numbers in the output grid, often expanding or shifting their positions.\n\n3. **Preservation of Certain Structures**: Some structures or patterns in the input grid are preserved in the output grid, either in their original form or with some transformation applied.\n\nGiven these observations, the solution involves iterating over the input grid, identifying the patterns or structures that need to be transformed according to the rules observed in the demonstrations, and constructing the output grid accordingly.\n\nHere's a Python function that implements the solution based on the observed patterns:\n\n```python\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(len(input_grid[0]))] for _ in range(len(input_grid))]\n    \n    # Iterate over the input grid to apply transformations\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):\n            # Apply transformations based on observed patterns from the demonstrations\n            # This is a placeholder for the specific logic based on the patterns you've identified\n            # For example, mirroring, expanding, or transforming numbers/colors\n            \n            # Direct copy for demonstration; replace with actual logic\n            output_grid[i][j] = input_grid[i][j]\n            \n            # Example transformation: Mirror elements horizontally in a specific row\n            # This is just an illustrative example and may not apply directly to the problem\n            if i == 5:  # Assuming we want to mirror elements in the 6th row\n                if j < len(input_grid[0]) // 2:\n                    output_grid[i][len(input_grid[0]) - 1 - j] = input_grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Return the transformed output grid\n    return output_grid\n\n# Example test case (replace with actual test case)\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    # Add the rest of the input grid rows here\n]\n\n# Solve the test case\noutput_grid = solve(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code provides a basic structure for solving the problem. You need to fill in the specific logic for transforming the input grid based on the patterns you observe in the demonstration examples. The example transformation provided in the code is illustrative and should be replaced with the actual logic that matches the patterns from the demonstrations."

The pattern involves expanding certain elements in the grid and transforming them according to specific rules. Here's a breakdown of the observed rules:\n\n1. **Expansion of Elements**: Certain elements (numbers) in the grid seem to expand or transform in a specific manner. For example, numbers like 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 transform into patterns that spread across their neighboring cells.\n2. **Transformation Rules**:\n   - The number **2** expands horizontally and vertically to adjacent cells.\n   - The number **3** transforms into a larger block of 3s, expanding horizontally.\n   - The number **4** expands into a larger block, similar to 3 but with a different arrangement.\n   - The number **6** expands horizontally.\n   - The number **8** expands into a larger block, filling all adjacent cells around it.\n\nGiven these rules, we can write a Python function to apply these transformations to the input grid and produce the output grid. The function will iterate through each cell in the input grid, apply the transformation rules based on the cell's value, and construct the output grid accordingly.\n\nHere's how we can implement the solution:\n\n```python\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(len(input_grid[0]))] for _ in range(len(input_grid))]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules for each number.\n    transformations = {\n        2: [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)],  # Horizontal and vertical expansion\n        3: [(0, 1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)],  # Horizontal expansion\n        4: [(0, 1), (1, 0)],  # Block expansion\n        6: [(0, 1)],  # Horizontal expansion\n        8: [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (-1, -1), (1, -1), (-1, 1)]  # Full surrounding expansion\n    }\n    \n    # Function to apply transformations based on the cell's value.\n    def apply_transformations(x, y, value):\n        if value in transformations:\n            for dx, dy in transformations[value]:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if 0 <= nx < len(output_grid) and 0 <= ny < len(output_grid[0]):\n                    output_grid[nx][ny] = value\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid and apply transformations.\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):\n            cell_value = input_grid[i][j]\n            # Copy the original value to the output grid.\n            output_grid[i][j] = cell_value\n            # Apply transformations if the cell contains a transformable value.\n            if cell_value in transformations:\n                apply_transformations(i, j, cell_value)\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test case\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Solve the test case\noutput_grid = solve(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code defines a `solve` function that takes an input grid, applies the transformation rules based on the observed patterns from the demonstration examples, and returns the transformed output grid.```\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.

From the demonstrations, it seems that the transformation from input to output follows a specific rule based on the presence of the number 5 in the input grid. Each cluster of 5s in the input grid is transformed into a cluster of incrementing numbers starting from 1 in the output grid, with each distinct cluster getting its own sequence of numbers starting from 1.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n1. Identify clusters of 5s in the input grid. A cluster is defined as a group of adjacent 5s horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).\n2. For each cluster, replace the 5s with incrementing numbers starting from 1. Each cluster should start the increment from 1 again.\n3. Return the transformed grid as the output.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_clusters(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    visited = set()\n    clusters = []\n\n    def dfs(r, c):\n        if (r, c) in visited or grid[r][c] != 5:\n            return []\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        cluster = [(r, c)]\n        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                cluster.extend(dfs(nr, nc))\n        return cluster\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5 and (r, c) not in visited:\n                clusters.append(dfs(r, c))\n    return clusters\n\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    clusters = find_clusters(input_grid)\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(len(input_grid[0]))] for _ in range(len(input_grid))]\n\n    for cluster in clusters:\n        for i, (r, c) in enumerate(sorted(cluster), start=1):\n            output_grid[r][c] = i\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test case\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], \n    [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5], \n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], \n    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\noutput = solve(input_grid)\nfor row in output:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code first identifies all the clusters of 5s in the input grid using a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Then, it creates an output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled initially with 0s. For each cluster found, it replaces the corresponding positions in the output grid with incrementing numbers starting from 1. Finally, it prints the transformed grid as the output."

From the demonstrations, it seems that the task involves replacing the number 5 in the input grid with a sequence of numbers in the output grid. The sequence of numbers in the output grid appears to be determined by the position and grouping of the number 5 in the input grid.\n\nLet's break down the pattern observed:\n- Each isolated group of the number 5 in the input grid is replaced with incrementing numbers starting from 1 in the output grid. The increment seems to be based on the order of appearance of these groups from top to bottom and left to right in the grid.\n- Each group of the number 5 that is connected (horizontally or vertically) is considered a single group and is replaced with the same number in the output grid.\n\nBased on this understanding, we can write a Python function to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros, matching the size of the input grid\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(len(input_grid[0]))] for _ in range(len(input_grid))]\n    \n    # Function to mark connected components and replace them with the current number\n    def fill_component(x, y, current_number):\n        if x < 0 or x >= len(input_grid) or y < 0 or y >= len(input_grid[0]) or input_grid[x][y] != 5:\n            return\n        # Replace the number 5 with the current number in the output grid\n        output_grid[x][y] = current_number\n        input_grid[x][y] = 0  # Mark as visited\n        \n        # Recursively fill connected components\n        fill_component(x+1, y, current_number)\n        fill_component(x-1, y, current_number)\n        fill_component(x, y+1, current_number)\n        fill_component(x, y-1, current_number)\n    \n    # Main logic to iterate through the grid and fill components\n    current_number = 1\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):\n            if input_grid[i][j] == 5:\n                fill_component(i, j, current_number)\n                current_number += 1  # Increment for the next group\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test case\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], \n    [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5], \n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], \n    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\noutput_grid = solve(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code defines a `solve` function that takes an input grid, identifies groups of the number 5, and replaces them with incrementing numbers based on their grouping, producing the output grid as described.```\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.

The increment seems to be based on the order of appearance of these groups from top to bottom and left to right in the grid.\n- Each group of the number 5 that is connected (horizontally or vertically) is considered a single group and is replaced with the same number in the output grid.\n\nBased on this understanding, we can write a Python function to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros, matching the size of the input grid\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(len(input_grid[0]))] for _ in range(len(input_grid))]\n    \n    # Function to mark connected components and replace them with the current number\n    def fill_component(x, y, current_number):\n        if x < 0 or x >= len(input_grid) or y < 0 or y >= len(input_grid[0]) or input_grid[x][y] != 5:\n            return\n        # Replace the number 5 with the current number in the output grid\n        output_grid[x][y] = current_number\n        input_grid[x][y] = 0  # Mark as visited\n        \n        # Recursively fill connected components\n        fill_component(x+1, y, current_number)\n        fill_component(x-1, y, current_number)\n        fill_component(x, y+1, current_number)\n        fill_component(x, y-1, current_number)\n    \n    # Main logic to iterate through the grid and fill components\n    current_number = 1\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):\n            if input_grid[i][j] == 5:\n                fill_component(i, j, current_number)\n                current_number += 1  # Increment for the next group\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test case\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], \n    [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5], \n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], \n    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\noutput_grid = solve(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code defines a `solve` function that takes an input grid, identifies groups of the number 5, and replaces them with incrementing numbers based on their grouping, producing the output grid as described."

From the demonstrations, it seems that the transformation from input to output follows a specific rule based on the presence of the number 5 in the input grid. Each cluster of 5s in the input grid is transformed into a cluster of incrementing numbers starting from 1 in the output grid, with each distinct cluster getting its own sequence of numbers starting from 1.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n1. Identify clusters of 5s in the input grid. A cluster is defined as a group of adjacent 5s horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).\n2. For each cluster, replace the 5s with incrementing numbers starting from 1. Each cluster should start the increment from 1 again.\n3. Return the transformed grid as the output.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_clusters(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    visited = set()\n    clusters = []\n\n    def dfs(r, c):\n        if (r, c) in visited or grid[r][c] != 5:\n            return []\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        cluster = [(r, c)]\n        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                cluster.extend(dfs(nr, nc))\n        return cluster\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5 and (r, c) not in visited:\n                clusters.append(dfs(r, c))\n    return clusters\n\ndef solve(input_grid):\n    clusters = find_clusters(input_grid)\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(len(input_grid[0]))] for _ in range(len(input_grid))]\n\n    for cluster in clusters:\n        for i, (r, c) in enumerate(sorted(cluster), start=1):\n            output_grid[r][c] = i\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test case\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], \n    [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5], \n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], \n    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\noutput = solve(input_grid)\nfor row in output:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code first identifies all the clusters of 5s in the input grid using a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Then, it creates an output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled initially with 0s. For each cluster found, it replaces the corresponding positions in the output grid with incrementing numbers starting from 1. Finally, it prints the transformed grid as the output.```\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.
