Initialize output to an empty list.\n2. For each input tuple:\n    - Create a new tuple by permuting the elements in the input tuple.\n    - If the new tuple is valid and not already in output, add it to output.\n    - Otherwise, backtrack and consider other permutations.\n3. Output the final output list.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n!), where n is the length of the input tuple. This is because the algorithm iterates over all possible permutations of the input tuple, and each permutation takes O(n!) time to generate."

The target array is constructed by adding two types of elements: 0s and 1s.\n\n3. There are multiple ways to achieve this construction. One approach is to use a combination of row operations and column operations.\n\n4. The solution involves the following steps:\n   - Create a new output array `output`.\n   - Initialize `output` with 0s.\n   - For each element in the input array `input`:\n     - If the element is 1, add two elements to `output` in a specific order (e.g., top-left corner).\n     - If the element is 0, add one element to `output`.\n   - Repeat this process for all elements in the input array.\n\n**Test Case Solution:**\n\n```python\noutput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n        [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n        [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1"
