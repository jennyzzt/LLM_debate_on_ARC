This can be done using the following steps:\n\n- Create a new grid of 3s.\n\n\n- Iterate over the original grid and group 8s together.\n\n\n- Fill in the empty 0s with 3s.\n\n\n- Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all 0s are filled.\n\n\n**Test Case Solution:**\n\n```\noutput = [[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 8], [8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0,"

This allows us to determine the output array's structure based on the input array.\n\n3. **Algorithm:** One possible algorithm is to perform the following steps:\n    - Initialize an output array with the same dimensions as the input array.\n    - For each element in the input array:\n        - Determine the operation to be performed based on the element's position in the input array.\n        - Apply the operation to the output array.\n        - Move to the next element in the input array.\n    - Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the output array is fully populated.\n\n4. **Test Case:** The test case provides input arrays with various structures and outputs the corresponding target arrays.
