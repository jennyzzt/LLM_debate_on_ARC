The operations can be performed in any order, and the final output array should have the same structure as the input array.\n\n2. **Observation:** The input array consists of blocks of identical elements. This observation can be used to construct the output array by grouping elements together.\n\n3. **Grouping:** Group elements in the input array based on their values. For example, elements with the same value should be grouped together.\n\n4. **Operations:** Once elements within a group are grouped together, perform the necessary operations to transform them into the desired output array. These operations can include swapping elements, moving elements around, or changing their values.\n\n5. **Output:** After grouping and performing the operations, the output array is constructed.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe solution to the problem is to use the following steps:\n\n1. Group elements in the input array based on their values.\n2. Perform the necessary operations to transform elements within each group.\n3. Combine the grouped elements into the output array.\n\n**Example:**\n\nFor the input array:\n\n```\ninput = [[8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nThe following operations can be performed to transform the array into the output array:\n\n* Group elements with the same value (elements with the same value should be grouped together).\n* Swap elements in the group of elements with the value 0.\n* Move elements in the group of elements with the value 0 to the end of the group.\n\nAfter performing these operations, the output array will be:\n\n```\noutput = [[8, 1, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]\n```"

The operations can be performed in any order, and the final output array should have the same structure as the input array.\n\n2. **Observation:** The input array consists of blocks of identical elements. This observation can be used to construct the output array by grouping elements together.\n\n3. **Grouping:** Group elements in the input array based on their values. For example, elements with the same value should be grouped together.\n\n4. **Operations:** Once elements within a group are grouped together, perform the necessary operations to transform them into the desired output array. These operations can include swapping elements, moving elements around, or changing their values.\n\n5. **Output:** After grouping and performing the operations, the output array is constructed.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe solution to the problem is to use the following steps:\n\n1. Group elements in the input array based on their values.\n2. Perform the necessary operations to transform elements within each group.\n3. Combine the grouped elements into the output array.\n\n**Example:**\n\nFor the input array:\n\n```\ninput = [[8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nThe following operations can be performed to transform the array into the output array:\n\n* Group elements with the same value (elements with the same value should be grouped together).\n* Swap elements in the group of elements with the value 0.\n* Move elements in the group of elements with the value 0 to the end of the group.\n\nAfter performing these operations, the output array will be:\n\n```\noutput = [[8, 1, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]\n``````\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.
