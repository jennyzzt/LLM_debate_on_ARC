The output grid size matches the input grid size.\n2. The value in each cell of the output grid seems to depend on the number of non-zero (5s in this case) elements in the corresponding row and column of the input grid.\n\nLet's break down the pattern:\n\n- If a row or column has 1 non-zero element, the corresponding output cells are filled with 3.\n- If a row or column has 2 non-zero elements, the corresponding output cells are filled with 4.\n- If a row or column has 3 non-zero elements, the corresponding output cells are filled with 3 again (as seen in the second demonstration).\n- If a row or column has no non-zero elements, the corresponding output cells are filled with 2.\n\nGiven the test case:\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 5], [5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0]]\n```\n\nLet's apply the pattern:\n\n- For the first row, there is 1 non-zero element in the row and 2 non-zero elements in the columns (for the third column). So, the output for the first row should be [3, 3, 4].\n- For the second row, there is 1 non-zero element in the row and 1 non-zero element in each column (for the first column).

Let's correct this and apply the correct reasoning to the test case.\n\nThe pattern seems to be based on the number of non-zero elements in each row and column, but the interpretations provided vary. Upon closer inspection, the correct approach should focus on the number of non-zero elements specifically in each row, as the first agent suggested, which directly influences the output values. The second agent's interpretation introduces a more complex analysis that doesn't consistently align with the examples.\n\nRevising the understanding based on the first agent's insight:\n\n1. The output values are determined by the count of non-zero elements in each row of the input grid.\n   - Three non-zero elements map to `[3, 3, 3]`.\n   - Two non-zero elements map to `[4, 4, 4]`.\n   - One non-zero element maps to `[2, 2, 2]`.\n   - Zero non-zero elements would logically map to `[1, 1, 1]`, though this scenario isn't demonstrated.\n\nApplying this corrected understanding to the test case:\n\nInput grid:\n```\n[[0, 0, 5], \n [5, 0, 0], \n [0, 5, 0]]\n```\n\n- Each row in the input grid has exactly one non-zero element.\n- According to the pattern, a row with one non-zero element corresponds to an output row of `[2, 2, 2]`.\n\nTherefore, the corrected output for the test case, aligning with the pattern identified by the first agent, is:\n```\noutput = [[2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2]]\n```"

In the first demonstration, the sequence `2, 3` is repeated, and in the second demonstration, the sequence `1, 4` is repeated. These sequences replace specific elements in the grid, often following a diagonal or adjacent pattern to the original numbers.\n\n2. **Preservation of Structure**: The overall structure of the grid (i.e., the placement of `8`s and `0`s) remains mostly unchanged, except for the parts where the sequence of numbers is introduced or expanded.\n\nGiven these observations, let's apply similar reasoning to solve the test case:\n\nThe input grid for the test case is:\n```\n[[8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], \n [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8], \n [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8], \n [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8], \n [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], \n [8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nTo generate the output, we need to identify the sequence of numbers and their pattern of replacement. The input grid contains the sequence `4, 3`, which suggests a continuation or modification of the sequences observed in the demonstrations. Given the context of the demonstrations, it's reasonable to infer that the sequence might expand or replace elements in a similar manner, but the specific sequence to apply is not directly provided in the test case.\n\nHowever, without a clear, consistent rule from the demonstrations to apply directly to the test case (since the demonstrations show different sequences and the test case does not directly indicate which sequence to use or how to apply it), we reach a point of ambiguity. \n\nGiven this, and without making arbitrary assumptions, the most accurate response is to acknowledge the inability to generate a specific output without further clarification on the rules for sequence generation and application in this new context. \n\nFor a precise solution, additional information or a more explicit pattern description from the demonstrations would be required, especially regarding how sequences are chosen and applied in new contexts.```\n\nOne agent's response: ```To solve this problem, let's analyze the pattern from the demonstration examples and apply it to the test case. The pattern involves replacing certain numbers with a sequence or modifying the grid based on specific rules observed from the demonstrations.\n\nFrom the demonstrations, we can observe that:\n- The number `8` remains unchanged unless it is part of a specific pattern that needs to be transformed.\n- Sequences of numbers (like `1, 4, 1, 4` or `3, 2, 3, 2`) are introduced based on the presence of other numbers (like `1`, `4`, `3`, `2`) in the input grid. These sequences seem to replace certain patterns of `8` and `0` in the grid.\n- The transformation rules are consistent across different parts of the grid and seem to depend on the specific numbers present and their arrangement.\n\nGiven the input for the test case, we notice the presence of numbers `4` and `3`, which are part of the sequences observed in the demonstrations.

For example, in rows with a single `4` or `3`, we might expect to see these numbers repeated or alternated based on their initial positions and the surrounding `8`s.\n- The presence of `4` and `3` in the input grid suggests that these numbers will likely form a sequence in the output, replacing certain `0`s or modifying the arrangement of `8`s.\n\nGiven the complexity of the pattern and the need for a precise output, let's focus on the key transformation based on the presence of `4` and `3`:\n- Sequences involving `4` and `3` are likely to be introduced in the output, especially in areas surrounding these numbers in the input.\n- The exact transformation can be complex, involving the replacement of `0`s with these numbers in a sequence or altering the arrangement of `8`s to incorporate these sequences.\n\nWithout a clear, specific rule from the demonstrations that can be directly applied due to the abstract nature of the problem and the variations in the input grid, generating an exact output requires making assumptions based on the observed patterns. \n\nHowever, given the need for a precise solution and the complexity of deriving an exact pattern from the provided demonstrations, it's challenging to provide an accurate output without further clarification on the rules for transformation, especially how sequences of `4` and `3` should be arranged in the context of the entire grid. \n\nFor a detailed, accurate solution, more information or a clearer set of transformation rules would be necessary.```\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.

In the first demonstration, the sequence `2, 3` is repeated, and in the second demonstration, the sequence `1, 4` is repeated. These sequences replace specific elements in the grid, often following a diagonal or adjacent pattern to the original numbers.\n\n2. **Preservation of Structure**: The overall structure of the grid (i.e., the placement of `8`s and `0`s) remains mostly unchanged, except for the parts where the sequence of numbers is introduced or expanded.\n\nGiven these observations, let's apply similar reasoning to solve the test case:\n\nThe input grid for the test case is:\n```\n[[8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], \n [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8], \n [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8], \n [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8], \n [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], \n [8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nTo generate the output, we need to identify the sequence of numbers and their pattern of replacement.

Given the context of the demonstrations, it's reasonable to infer that the sequence might expand or replace elements in a similar manner, but the specific sequence to apply is not directly provided in the test case.\n\nHowever, without a clear, consistent rule from the demonstrations to apply directly to the test case (since the demonstrations show different sequences and the test case does not directly indicate which sequence to use or how to apply it), we reach a point of ambiguity. \n\nGiven this, and without making arbitrary assumptions, the most accurate response is to acknowledge the inability to generate a specific output without further clarification on the rules for sequence generation and application in this new context. \n\nFor a precise solution, additional information or a more explicit pattern description from the demonstrations would be required, especially regarding how sequences are chosen and applied in new contexts."

The pattern involves replacing certain numbers with a sequence or modifying the grid based on specific rules observed from the demonstrations.\n\nFrom the demonstrations, we can observe that:\n- The number `8` remains unchanged unless it is part of a specific pattern that needs to be transformed.\n- Sequences of numbers (like `1, 4, 1, 4` or `3, 2, 3, 2`) are introduced based on the presence of other numbers (like `1`, `4`, `3`, `2`) in the input grid. These sequences seem to replace certain patterns of `8` and `0` in the grid.\n- The transformation rules are consistent across different parts of the grid and seem to depend on the specific numbers present and their arrangement.\n\nGiven the input for the test case, we notice the presence of numbers `4` and `3`, which are part of the sequences observed in the demonstrations.

For example, in rows with a single `4` or `3`, we might expect to see these numbers repeated or alternated based on their initial positions and the surrounding `8`s.\n- The presence of `4` and `3` in the input grid suggests that these numbers will likely form a sequence in the output, replacing certain `0`s or modifying the arrangement of `8`s.\n\nGiven the complexity of the pattern and the need for a precise output, let's focus on the key transformation based on the presence of `4` and `3`:\n- Sequences involving `4` and `3` are likely to be introduced in the output, especially in areas surrounding these numbers in the input.\n- The exact transformation can be complex, involving the replacement of `0`s with these numbers in a sequence or altering the arrangement of `8`s to incorporate these sequences.\n\nWithout a clear, specific rule from the demonstrations that can be directly applied due to the abstract nature of the problem and the variations in the input grid, generating an exact output requires making assumptions based on the observed patterns. \n\nHowever, given the need for a precise solution and the complexity of deriving an exact pattern from the provided demonstrations, it's challenging to provide an accurate output without further clarification on the rules for transformation, especially how sequences of `4` and `3` should be arranged in the context of the entire grid. \n\nFor a detailed, accurate solution, more information or a clearer set of transformation rules would be necessary.```\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.

The pattern involves replacing certain numbers with a sequence or modifying the grid based on specific rules observed from the demonstrations.\n\nFrom the demonstrations, we can observe that:\n- The number `8` remains unchanged unless it is part of a specific pattern that needs to be transformed.\n- Sequences of numbers (like `1, 4, 1, 4` or `3, 2, 3, 2`) are introduced based on the presence of other numbers (like `1`, `4`, `3`, `2`) in the input grid. These sequences seem to replace certain patterns of `8` and `0` in the grid.\n- The transformation rules are consistent across different parts of the grid and seem to depend on the specific numbers present and their arrangement.\n\nGiven the input for the test case, we notice the presence of numbers `4` and `3`, which are part of the sequences observed in the demonstrations. Based on the patterns observed, we will apply similar transformations to the test case input.\n\nThe input grid for the test case is:\n```\n[[8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8], [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8], [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8], [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nTo generate the output, we follow the observed rules:\n- The sequence `4, 3` suggests alternating these numbers in places where patterns allow. For example, in rows with a single `4` or `3`, we might expect to see these numbers repeated or alternated based on their initial positions and the surrounding `8`s.\n- The presence of `4` and `3` in the input grid suggests that these numbers will likely form a sequence in the output, replacing certain `0`s or modifying the arrangement of `8`s.\n\nGiven the complexity of the pattern and the need for a precise output, let's focus on the key transformation based on the presence of `4` and `3`:\n- Sequences involving `4` and `3` are likely to be introduced in the output, especially in areas surrounding these numbers in the input.\n- The exact transformation can be complex, involving the replacement of `0`s with these numbers in a sequence or altering the arrangement of `8`s to incorporate these sequences.\n\nWithout a clear, specific rule from the demonstrations that can be directly applied due to the abstract nature of the problem and the variations in the input grid, generating an exact output requires making assumptions based on the observed patterns. \n\nHowever, given the need for a precise solution and the complexity of deriving an exact pattern from the provided demonstrations, it's challenging to provide an accurate output without further clarification on the rules for transformation, especially how sequences of `4` and `3` should be arranged in the context of the entire grid. \n\nFor a detailed, accurate solution, more information or a clearer set of transformation rules would be necessary."

In the first demonstration, the sequence `2, 3` is repeated, and in the second demonstration, the sequence `1, 4` is repeated. These sequences replace specific elements in the grid, often following a diagonal or adjacent pattern to the original numbers.\n\n2. **Preservation of Structure**: The overall structure of the grid (i.e., the placement of `8`s and `0`s) remains mostly unchanged, except for the parts where the sequence of numbers is introduced or expanded.\n\nGiven these observations, let's apply similar reasoning to solve the test case:\n\nThe input grid for the test case is:\n```\n[[8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], \n [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8], \n [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8], \n [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8], \n [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], \n [8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nTo generate the output, we need to identify the sequence of numbers and their pattern of replacement. The input grid contains the sequence `4, 3`, which suggests a continuation or modification of the sequences observed in the demonstrations. Given the context of the demonstrations, it's reasonable to infer that the sequence might expand or replace elements in a similar manner, but the specific sequence to apply is not directly provided in the test case.\n\nHowever, without a clear, consistent rule from the demonstrations to apply directly to the test case (since the demonstrations show different sequences and the test case does not directly indicate which sequence to use or how to apply it), we reach a point of ambiguity. \n\nGiven this, and without making arbitrary assumptions, the most accurate response is to acknowledge the inability to generate a specific output without further clarification on the rules for sequence generation and application in this new context. \n\nFor a precise solution, additional information or a more explicit pattern description from the demonstrations would be required, especially regarding how sequences are chosen and applied in new contexts.```\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.

These sequences seem to follow a certain logic based on their initial positions and surrounding elements.\n\n2. **Preservation of `8`s**: The number `8` remains largely unchanged except where sequences involving other numbers are introduced.\n\n3. **Pattern Formation**: The sequences of numbers (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`) appear to be strategically placed to form patterns, which might be influenced by the presence and arrangement of these numbers in the input grid.\n\nApplying these observations to the test case, we notice the presence of `4` and `3` in the input grid, suggesting that these numbers could form part of a sequence or pattern in the output.

The task requires a detailed understanding of how sequences are chosen and applied, which is not fully evident from the demonstrations provided.\n\nTherefore, while we can infer that the output should involve a strategic placement of `4` and `3` in sequences, possibly alternating or following a pattern influenced by their positions in the input grid, the exact output remains speculative without a clearer set of transformation rules."

This arrangement is somewhat similar to the third demonstration, but with an additional block and different placements.\n\nFollowing the observed pattern, the output for the test case should maintain the spatial relationships but in a condensed form.

Another block of the same size as the second, but separated horizontally and located to the right.\n\nTranslating this pattern into the 9x9 output grid, while keeping the relative positions and sizes in mind, we get:\n```\noutput = [\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]\n]\n```\n\nThis output reflects the arrangement and relative sizes of the clusters of '5's in the input grid, condensed into a 9x9 grid format.```\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.

This arrangement is somewhat similar to the third demonstration, but with an additional block and different placements.\n\nFollowing the observed pattern, the output for the test case should maintain the spatial relationships but in a condensed form.

A large block in the middle of the grid, spanning three rows.\n2. A smaller block below it, spanning three rows but narrower.\n3. Another block of the same size as the second, but separated horizontally and located to the right.\n\nTranslating this pattern into the 9x9 output grid, while keeping the relative positions and sizes in mind, we get:\n```\noutput = [\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]\n]\n```\n\nThis output reflects the arrangement and relative sizes of the clusters of '5's in the input grid, condensed into a 9x9 grid format.```\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.

This arrangement is somewhat similar to the third demonstration, but with an additional block and different placements.\n\nFollowing the observed pattern, the output for the test case should maintain the spatial relationships but in a condensed form.

However, the additional opinions suggest considering clusters that form squares or rectangles, which doesn't exactly align with the examples provided or the test case.\n\n2. **Maintaining the rest of the grid unchanged**: Cells that do not meet the criteria for transformation (either because they are '0's, they are single '1's, or they do not form part of a horizontal or vertical line of three '1's) remain unchanged.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct approach seems to be to focus on horizontal or vertical lines of three '1's for transformation into '2's, as initially described. This approach aligns with the demonstration examples and the observable pattern.\n\nLet's apply this corrected understanding to the test case:\n\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], \n         [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], \n         [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], \n         [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], \n         [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]]\n```\n\nApplying the correct transformation rules:\n\n- Horizontal lines of three '1's are transformed into '2's. This occurs in rows 2, 3, 4, 8, and 10 (using 1-based indexing).\n- Vertical transformations do not apply as there are no vertical lines of three '1's.\n\nThus, the corrected output is:\n\n```\noutput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2], \n          [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], \n          [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], \n          [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], \n          [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]]\n```\n\nThis output correctly reflects the transformation of horizontal lines of three '1's into '2's, while the rest of the grid remains unchanged, aligning with the observed rules from the demonstration examples."

The first row has 5s but no 7s directly adjacent to them, suggesting a pattern similar to the first row of some outputs where 3s are placed in the last column.\n2. The second row has a sequence of 7s followed by 5s, which in previous examples led to a row of 3s, suggesting a full row of 3s might be appropriate here.\n3.

The pattern seems to involve transforming the input grid into a smaller 3x3 output grid based on certain rules related to the presence and arrangement of specific numbers in the input grid. Here are some observations:\n\n1. The output grid size is consistently 3x3.\n2. The transformation rules seem to depend on the presence of certain numbers (7, 1, 5) in specific positions within the input grid.\n3. The number 3 in the output grid appears to represent a significant pattern or condition derived from the input grid.\n\nGiven these observations, let's try to deduce the rules:\n\n- The presence of 7s in the input grid seems to influence the placement of 3s in the output grid.\n- The number 1 in the input grid is consistently in the middle column but does not directly influence the output pattern.\n- The arrangement and presence of 5s in relation to 7s and their positions might influence where 3s are placed in the output grid.\n\nBased on these rules and observations, let's solve the test case:\n\nInput:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0], [7, 7, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5]]\n```\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The first row has 5s but no 7s directly adjacent to them, suggesting a pattern similar to the first row of some outputs where 3s are placed in the last column.\n2. The second row has a sequence of 7s followed by 5s, which in previous examples led to a row of 3s, suggesting a full row of 3s might be appropriate here.\n3. The third row has a single 5 with no adjacent 7s, which doesn't match any clear pattern for placing a 3 in the output.\n4. The fourth row has a 7 followed by 5s, similar to conditions that led to 3s being placed in the output, suggesting a 3 might be placed in the last column.\n\nGiven these observations and trying to match the patterns from the demonstrations, the output for the test case seems to be:\n\n```\noutput = [[0, 0, 3], [3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3]]\n```\n\nThis output follows the observed rules and patterns from the demonstrations, considering the placement of 7s and 5s in the input grid and their influence on where 3s are placed in the output grid.```\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.

Let's refine our understanding and approach based on the collective insights:\n\n1. **Output Grid Size**: The output grid size is consistently 4x3 across all demonstrations, not 3x3 as one of the agents suggested. This remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Role of Numbers 7, 1, and 5**: The presence of the number 7 in the first three columns, the number 1 in the fourth column, and the number 5 in the last three columns of the input grid seem to dictate the placement of the number 3 in the output grid. This rule aligns with the initial observation and is not directly challenged by the other agents' insights.\n\n3. **Interpretation of Patterns**: The presence of a 5 to the right of a 1 in the input grid influences the placement of a 3 in the corresponding position in the output grid, as suggested by one agent. However, upon closer inspection, the consistent rule across all demonstrations is more about the presence of 7, 1, and 5 in specific columns rather than their adjacency or direct interaction.\n\n4. **Clarification and Correction**: The correct interpretation should focus on the specific columns where 7, 1, and 5 appear in the input grid and how these appearances translate into the placement of 3s in the output grid, as initially outlined.\n\nApplying the clarified rules to the test case:\n\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0], [7, 7, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5]]\n```\n\n- For the first row: No 7 in the first three columns, 1 is in the fourth column, and 5 is in the last three columns. So, the output is [0, 3, 3].\n- For the second row: 7 is in the first three columns, 1 is in the fourth column, and 5 is in the last three columns. So, the output is [3, 3, 3].\n- For the third row: No 7 in the first three columns, 1 is in the fourth column, and 5 is in the last three columns. So, the output is [0, 3, 3].\n- For the fourth row: 7 is in the first three columns, 1 is in the fourth column, and 5 is in the last three columns. So, the output is [3, 3, 3].\n\nTherefore, the corrected and refined solution to the test case, taking into account the collective insights and a more accurate interpretation of the patterns, is:\n\n```\noutput = [[0, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3], [0, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3]]\n```\n\nThis solution aligns with the clarified understanding of how the presence of numbers 7, 1, and 5 in specific columns of the input grid influences the placement of 3s in the output grid."

The transformation from the input grid to the output grid seems to follow a specific rule based on the presence and arrangement of certain numbers in the input grid. Here's a breakdown of the observed patterns:\n\n1. The output grid is always a 4x3 grid.\n2. The transformation seems to focus on the presence of the numbers 7, 1, and 5 in the input grid, particularly their arrangement in relation to each other.\n3. The number 3 in the output grid appears to represent a specific pattern or condition met in the input grid.\n\nBy analyzing the demonstrations, we can infer the following rules:\n\n- The presence of 7s in the input grid does not directly influence the output. Instead, their arrangement might affect the positioning of 3s in the output grid.\n- The number 1 in the input grid seems to act as a pivotal point for the transformation.\n- The presence and arrangement of 5s relative to 1 seem to dictate where 3s appear in the output grid. Specifically, if a 5 is directly adjacent to a 1 (either horizontally or vertically), it influences the placement of 3s in the output grid.\n\nGiven these observations, let's apply the rules to the test case:\n\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0], [7, 7, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5]]\n```\n\n- For the first row, there is a 5 to the right of 1, which might influence the placement of a 3 in the corresponding position in the output grid.\n- For the second row, there is a 5 to the right of 1 and also another 5 further right, indicating a similar pattern that might influence the placement of 3s.\n- For the third row, there is a 5 to the right of 1, similar to the first row.\n- For the fourth row, there is a 5 to the right of 1 and additional 5s further right, similar to the second row.\n\nBased on the pattern observed in the demonstrations, the output seems to be influenced by the presence of 5s adjacent to 1s.

Let's analyze the demonstrations to identify the transformation rules:\n\n1. The output grid size is always 4x3 (4 rows and 3 columns).\n2. The transformation seems to be related to the presence of certain numbers in specific positions within the input grid. Specifically, the numbers 7, 1, and 5 seem to play a significant role.\n3. The output grid uses the number 3 as a marker, which seems to indicate a certain condition being met in the input grid.\n\nBy closely examining the input and output pairs, we can infer the following rules:\n\n- The first column in the output grid is filled with 3 if there is a 7 in the first three columns of the corresponding row in the input grid.\n- The second column in the output grid is filled with 3 if there is a 1 in the fourth column of the corresponding row in the input grid.\n- The third column in the output grid is filled with 3 if there is a 5 in the last three columns of the corresponding row in the input grid.\n\nApplying these rules to the test case:\n\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0], [7, 7, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5]]\n```\n\n- For the first row: No 7 in the first three columns, 1 is in the fourth column, and 5 is in the last three columns.

Based on the rules observed in the demonstrations, we will apply similar transformations to solve the test case.\n\nThe input grid for the test case is as follows:\n- There's a pattern of 8s that form a square, which is expected to expand or duplicate.\n- Numbers 4, 3, and 2 seem to be part of smaller patterns that might expand or transform.\n- The number 1 appears in specific positions, possibly indicating a starting point for a pattern or a transformation.\n\nApplying these observations to the test case, we predict the output by expanding the patterns, transforming the numbers, and duplicating or mirroring the patterns as observed in the demonstrations. \n\nGiven the complexity and the need for precise transformations, let's focus on the key transformations observed in the input:\n\n1. The square of 8s will likely expand or duplicate based on the surrounding empty spaces.\n2.

The correct approach involves analyzing the patterns and transformations in the demonstrations to predict how the elements in the input grid should change or move.

For example, a single element might duplicate to its right or below, and sequences of elements might expand outward.\n\n3. **Apply the pattern to the test case**: Use the observed rules to transform the input grid into the output grid.\n\nGiven the test case input:\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nApplying the observed pattern to the test case, we get the following output:\n```\noutput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0,```\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.

The key observations from the demonstrations include:\n\n1. **Expansion of Patterns:** Patterns such as sequences of numbers or shapes expand, often doubling in size or extending in a specific direction.\n2. **Transformation and Duplication:** Certain elements transform into other elements or duplicate based on their surroundings.\n3. **Mirroring:** Some patterns are mirrored or reflected across an axis.\n\nGiven these insights, let's analyze the test case input and apply the rules to predict the output.\n\n### Test Case Analysis\n\n- The pattern of `8`s forms a specific shape that seems to expand or duplicate.\n- The numbers `2`, `3`, and `4` are positioned in a way that suggests they might expand outward or transform based on their adjacency to other numbers.\n- The `1`s are isolated but based on the demonstrations, they might act as seeds for new patterns or expansions.\n\n### Applying the Rules\n\n1. **Expansion of `8`s:** The `8`s in the input form a shape that is likely to expand or duplicate. In the demonstrations, similar shapes expanded outward or duplicated in adjacent spaces.\n2. **Transformation of `2`, `3`, and `4`:** These numbers are adjacent to `8`s and each other, suggesting a possible outward expansion or transformation. For example, `2` and `3` might expand to form a larger block or transform into another number based on their adjacency to `8`.\n3. **Duplication and Mirroring of `1`s:** The `1`s might duplicate or mirror based on their positions, potentially expanding into new patterns.\n\n### Predicting the Output\n\nGiven the complexity of the input and the need to apply multiple transformation rules, the output will involve expanding the patterns of `8`s, transforming the `2`, `3`, and `4` based on their positions, and duplicating or mirroring the `1`s. However, without explicit transformation rules for each number and their combinations, predicting the exact output requires making assumptions based on the observed patterns.\n\nConsidering the patterns and applying the general rules observed:\n\n- The `8`s might expand to form a larger block or duplicate.\n- The `2`, `3`, and `4` could expand outward, filling spaces adjacent to the `8`s or transforming into new patterns.\n- The `1`s might duplicate or mirror, creating new patterns.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWithout specific instructions on how each number transforms or duplicates, we can only hypothesize the general behavior of the patterns. The correct output would involve applying these general rules to the input grid, leading to an expansion of the `8`s, a transformation or expansion of the `2`, `3`, and `4`, and a duplication or mirroring of the `1`s. Given the need for precise transformations and the complexity of the input, a detailed and accurate prediction of the output requires a more explicit set of transformation rules for each element and their interactions."

The rules observed are as follows:\n\n1. **Expansion of Patterns:** Patterns such as squares or lines expand outward or in a specific direction, doubling in size or following a specific growth pattern.\n2. **Color or Number Transformation:** Specific numbers or colors transform into other numbers or colors, often expanding in size or changing position based on their surroundings.\n3. **Mirroring or Duplication:** Some patterns are mirrored or duplicated adjacent to their original position.\n\nGiven the input for the test case, we observe patterns involving numbers 8, 4, 3, 2, and 1, which are placed in specific configurations. Based on the rules observed in the demonstrations, we will apply similar transformations to solve the test case.\n\nThe input grid for the test case is as follows:\n- There's a pattern of 8s that form a square, which is expected to expand or duplicate.\n- Numbers 4, 3, and 2 seem to be part of smaller patterns that might expand or transform.\n- The number 1 appears in specific positions, possibly indicating a starting point for a pattern or a transformation.\n\nApplying these observations to the test case, we predict the output by expanding the patterns, transforming the numbers, and duplicating or mirroring the patterns as observed in the demonstrations. \n\nGiven the complexity and the need for precise transformations, let's focus on the key transformations observed in the input:\n\n1.

These numbers are expected to expand, duplicate, or transform in a manner similar to the demonstration tasks.\n\nHere's how we apply the observed rules to the test case:\n\n1. **Expansion of 8s**: The pattern of 8s suggests an expansion where these numbers might form a larger block or duplicate in adjacent cells.\n2. **Transformation of 2s and 3s**: The 2s and 3s adjacent to 8s might expand or duplicate, creating a pattern that extends from their original positions.\n3. **Duplication of 1s**: The sequence of 1s indicates a starting point for a pattern that might expand or duplicate, similar to the observed demonstrations.\n\nApplying these rules to the test case, we predict the output by expanding the patterns of 8s, transforming the numbers 4, 3, and 2, and duplicating the patterns as observed in the demonstrations.\n\nGiven the complexity of the transformations and the need for a specific solution, let's focus on the key transformations observed in the input:\n\n- The square of 8s will likely expand or duplicate based on the surrounding empty spaces.\n- The numbers 4, 3, and 2, which are adjacent to each other, might expand outward, filling the surrounding spaces.\n- The isolated numbers, such as the 1s and 2s towards the bottom, might act as seeds for new patterns or expansions.\n\nConsidering these rules and applying them to the input grid, we get the following output:\n\n```\noutput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nThis output reflects the initial state of the input without any transformation, which is incorrect based on the task requirements. The correct approach should involve analyzing the patterns and transformations in the demonstrations to predict how the elements in the input grid should change or move.

Without specific transformation rules derived from the demonstrations, it's challenging to provide an accurate output."

For example, a single element might duplicate to its right or below, and sequences of elements might expand outward.\n\n3. **Apply the pattern to the test case**: Use the observed rules to transform the input grid into the output grid.\n\nGiven the test case input:\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nApplying the observed pattern to the test case, we get the following output:\n```\noutput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0,"

The correct pattern involves placing a `1` in specific positions relative to the `8`s, but the exact rule needs to be clarified based on the conflicting interpretations.\n\nGiven the discrepancies in the interpretations, let's synthesize a more accurate rule based on the demonstrations and apply it to the test case:\n\n1. The output grid is the same size as the input grid.\n2. The number `8` in the input grid remains unchanged in the output grid.\n3. A number `1` is placed in cells that are directly adjacent (to the right or below) to an `8`, provided that the adjacent cell does not already contain an `8`.\n\nThis rule combines the observed patterns and aims to correct the initial misunderstanding.

This interpretation reconciles the observed patterns and the need for a consistent rule across all examples.\n\nApplying this refined understanding to the test case:\n\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], \n         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], \n         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], \n         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nFollowing the refined rule:\n\n- A `1` is placed to the right of an `8` if the right cell is a `0`.\n- A `1` is placed below an `8` if the below cell is a `0`.\n\nHowever, considering the grid's bounds and the positions of `8`s, we must carefully apply these rules to ensure accuracy. After a detailed review, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the pattern interpretation in the previous responses. The correct pattern involves placing `1`s diagonally to the bottom-right of each `8`, where applicable, and ensuring it aligns with the demonstrated examples.\n\nTherefore, correctly applying the pattern to the test case, we get:\n\n```\noutput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], \n          [8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8], \n          [8, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 1, 0], \n          [0, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], \n          [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nThis output reflects the placement of `1`s diagonally to the bottom-right of each `8`, where the grid allows, and corrects the earlier misinterpretation."

By examining the demonstration inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can observe the following pattern:\n\n1. Each `5` in the input grid is transformed into a specific number in the output grid. This transformation seems to depend on the position of the `5` within certain shapes or patterns formed by adjacent `5`s.\n2. From the demonstrations, it appears that the transformation rule is based on the count of adjacent `5`s, including diagonally adjacent ones, to determine the output number. Specifically:\n   - If a `5` is part of a larger block or cluster, it transforms into `1`.\n   - If a `5` is part of a line or smaller cluster, it transforms into `2` or `3`, depending on its position and the shape of the cluster.\n\nApplying this understanding to the test case input, we can transform each `5` based on its adjacency to other `5`s:\n\n```\ninput = [\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nTransforming the `5`s based on the observed rules:\n\n- The single `5`s on the rightmost column and the bottom left corner transform into `1` because they are isolated.\n- The cluster of `5`s in the middle of the grid (both the horizontal line and the block) transform into `2` because they are part of a line or a small cluster.\n- The vertical line of `5`s on the left transforms into `3` because it's a different form of a small cluster.\n\nThus, the output for the test case is:\n\n```\noutput = [\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1],\n[0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n``````\n\nOne agent's response: ```To solve this problem, let's first understand the pattern from the demonstration examples. The transformation from input to output grids seems to involve changing the value of the colored cells (with a value of 5 in the input) to a specific number in the output, based on their position or configuration. By examining the demonstrations, we can deduce the following rules:\n\n1. **Single isolated cells** in the input grid (cells with a value of 5 that do not touch any other cells with a value of 5 horizontally or vertically) are transformed into cells with a value of **2** in the output grid.\n2. **Vertical pairs** of cells (two cells with a value of 5, one above the other) are transformed into cells with a value of **1** in the output grid.\n3. **Horizontal pairs** of cells (two cells with a value of 5, side by side) are transformed into cells with a value of **3** in the output grid.\n4. **Corner touching cells** (cells with a value of 5 that touch each other only at the corners) seem to be transformed into cells with a value of **4** in the output grid. However, there's no example of this in the demonstrations, but it's a reasonable assumption based on the pattern of increasing numbers for different configurations.\n\nGiven these rules, let's apply them to the test case:\n\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], \n         [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5], \n         [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], \n         [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nApplying the rules to the test case:\n\n- The **single isolated cells** (at the right edge in rows 1, 2, 3, and 4) become **2**.\n- The **vertical pairs** (at the left edge in rows 7-8-9 and the middle in rows 8-9) become **1**.\n- The **horizontal pairs** (in row 3 for two pairs and in row 4 for one pair) become **3**.\n\nThus, the output grid following these rules would be:\n\n```\noutput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], \n          [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2], \n          [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], \n          [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n``````\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.

By examining the demonstration inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can observe the following pattern:\n\n1. Each `5` in the input grid is transformed into a specific number in the output grid. This transformation seems to depend on the position of the `5` within certain shapes or patterns formed by adjacent `5`s.\n2. From the demonstrations, it appears that the transformation rule is based on the count of adjacent `5`s, including diagonally adjacent ones, to determine the output number. Specifically:\n   - If a `5` is part of a larger block or cluster, it transforms into `1`.\n   - If a `5` is part of a line or smaller cluster, it transforms into `2` or `3`, depending on its position and the shape of the cluster.\n\nApplying this understanding to the test case input, we can transform each `5` based on its adjacency to other `5`s:\n\n```\ninput = [\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nTransforming the `5`s based on the observed rules:\n\n- The single `5`s on the rightmost column and the bottom left corner transform into `1` because they are isolated.\n- The cluster of `5`s in the middle of the grid (both the horizontal line and the block) transform into `2` because they are part of a line or a small cluster.\n- The vertical line of `5`s on the left transforms into `3` because it's a different form of a small cluster.\n\nThus, the output for the test case is:\n\n```\noutput = [\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1],\n[0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```"

The transformation from input to output grids seems to involve changing the value of the colored cells (with a value of 5 in the input) to a specific number in the output, based on their position or configuration. By examining the demonstrations, we can deduce the following rules:\n\n1. **Single isolated cells** in the input grid (cells with a value of 5 that do not touch any other cells with a value of 5 horizontally or vertically) are transformed into cells with a value of **2** in the output grid.\n2. **Vertical pairs** of cells (two cells with a value of 5, one above the other) are transformed into cells with a value of **1** in the output grid.\n3. **Horizontal pairs** of cells (two cells with a value of 5, side by side) are transformed into cells with a value of **3** in the output grid.\n4. **Corner touching cells** (cells with a value of 5 that touch each other only at the corners) seem to be transformed into cells with a value of **4** in the output grid. However, there's no example of this in the demonstrations, but it's a reasonable assumption based on the pattern of increasing numbers for different configurations.\n\nGiven these rules, let's apply them to the test case:\n\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], \n         [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5], \n         [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], \n         [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nApplying the rules to the test case:\n\n- The **single isolated cells** (at the right edge in rows 1, 2, 3, and 4) become **2**.\n- The **vertical pairs** (at the left edge in rows 7-8-9 and the middle in rows 8-9) become **1**.\n- The **horizontal pairs** (in row 3 for two pairs and in row 4 for one pair) become **3**.\n\nThus, the output grid following these rules would be:\n\n```\noutput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], \n          [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2], \n          [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], \n          [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n``````\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the transformation rules in the provided opinions. Let's clarify and apply the correct transformation rules to the test case:\n\n1. **Isolated `5`s** (those not adjacent to any other `5`s, including diagonally) transform into `2`s.\n2. **Vertical or horizontal pairs of `5`s** transform based on their adjacency:\n   - If they form a line (either horizontal or vertical) without forming a 2x2 block, they transform into `3`s.\n   - If they are part of a 2x2 block, they transform into `1`s.\n3. **Single `5`s at the edges or corners** without specific adjacency rules mentioned in the previous agents' responses actually transform based on their adjacency to other `5`s rather than their location. The correct rule seems to involve transforming based on the pattern or cluster they belong to rather than their edge or corner location.\n\nGiven these clarifications, let's apply the correct rules to the test case:\n\n```\ninput = [\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nTransforming based on the corrected understanding:\n\n- The **isolated `5`s** on the rightmost column transform into `2`s.\n- The **vertical line of `5`s** on the left transforms into `3`s because it forms a vertical line without forming a 2x2 block.\n- The **pairs of `5`s** in the middle of the grid (both the horizontal line and the block) transform into `3`s because they are part of a line or a small cluster, not forming a 2x2 block.\n\nThus, the corrected output for the test case is:\n\n```\noutput = [\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n[0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2],\n[0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nThis output aligns with the corrected interpretation of the transformation rules based on the adjacency and configuration of `5`s in the input grid."

The transformation from input to output grids seems to involve changing the value of the colored cells (with a value of 5 in the input) to a specific number in the output, based on their position or configuration. By examining the demonstrations, we can deduce the following rules:\n\n1. **Single isolated cells** in the input grid (cells with a value of 5 that do not touch any other cells with a value of 5 horizontally or vertically) are transformed into cells with a value of **2** in the output grid.\n2. **Vertical pairs** of cells (two cells with a value of 5, one above the other) are transformed into cells with a value of **1** in the output grid.\n3. **Horizontal pairs** of cells (two cells with a value of 5, side by side) are transformed into cells with a value of **3** in the output grid.\n4. **Corner touching cells** (cells with a value of 5 that touch each other only at the corners) seem to be transformed into cells with a value of **4** in the output grid. However, there's no example of this in the demonstrations, but it's a reasonable assumption based on the pattern of increasing numbers for different configurations.\n\nGiven these rules, let's apply them to the test case:\n\n```\ninput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], \n         [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5], \n         [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n         [5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], \n         [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], \n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nApplying the rules to the test case:\n\n- The **single isolated cells** (at the right edge in rows 1, 2, 3, and 4) become **2**.\n- The **vertical pairs** (at the left edge in rows 7-8-9 and the middle in rows 8-9) become **1**.\n- The **horizontal pairs** (in row 3 for two pairs and in row 4 for one pair) become **3**.\n\nThus, the output grid following these rules would be:\n\n```\noutput = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], \n          [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2], \n          [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n          [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], \n          [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], \n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```"

By examining the demonstration inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can observe the following pattern:\n\n1. Each `5` in the input grid is transformed into a specific number in the output grid. This transformation seems to depend on the position of the `5` within certain shapes or patterns formed by adjacent `5`s.\n2. From the demonstrations, it appears that the transformation rule is based on the count of adjacent `5`s, including diagonally adjacent ones, to determine the output number. Specifically:\n   - If a `5` is part of a larger block or cluster, it transforms into `1`.\n   - If a `5` is part of a line or smaller cluster, it transforms into `2` or `3`, depending on its position and the shape of the cluster.\n\nApplying this understanding to the test case input, we can transform each `5` based on its adjacency to other `5`s:\n\n```\ninput = [\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nTransforming the `5`s based on the observed rules:\n\n- The single `5`s on the rightmost column and the bottom left corner transform into `1` because they are isolated.\n- The cluster of `5`s in the middle of the grid (both the horizontal line and the block) transform into `2` because they are part of a line or a small cluster.\n- The vertical line of `5`s on the left transforms into `3` because it's a different form of a small cluster.\n\nThus, the output for the test case is:\n\n```\noutput = [\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1],\n[0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n``````\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.

Let's correct this and apply a more accurate interpretation based on the patterns observed:\n\n1. **Single isolated cells** (cells with a value of 5 that do not touch any other cells with a value of 5 horizontally or vertically) are transformed into cells with a value of **2** in the output grid. This rule seems consistent across the examples and my initial analysis.\n2. **Vertical pairs** of cells (two cells with a value of 5, one above the other) are transformed into cells with a value of **1** in the output grid. This interpretation remains correct.\n3. **Horizontal pairs** of cells (two cells with a value of 5, side by side) are transformed into cells with a value of **3** in the output grid.

The transformation of **isolated 5s at the edges or corners** into **2s** and the absence of a rule for transforming cells into **4s** based on corner touching was an incorrect assumption on my part.
