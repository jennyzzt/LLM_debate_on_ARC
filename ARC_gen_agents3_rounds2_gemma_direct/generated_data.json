The new tuple is created by rearranging the elements of the original tuple in a different order.\n\n5. **Constraints:** The new tuple must satisfy the following constraints:\n   - The elements must appear in a different order.\n   - Each element must appear exactly once.\n   - The new tuple must be a permutation of the original tuple.\n\n6. **Output:** The output list contains tuples that represent all possible permutations of the input list.\n\n**Test Case Solution:**\n\n```python\noutput = [[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 8], [8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0"

The new tuple is created by rearranging the elements of the original tuple in a different order.\n\n5. **Constraints:** The new tuple must satisfy the following constraints:\n   - The elements must appear in a different order.\n   - Each element must appear exactly once.\n   - The new tuple must be a permutation of the original tuple.\n\n6. **Output:** The output list contains tuples that represent all possible permutations of the input list.\n\n**Test Case Solution:**\n\n```python\noutput = [[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 8], [8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0```\n\nOne agent's response: ```**Reason:**\n\n1. **Abstraction:**\n   - The task is to transform a given list of tuples into a new list of tuples, where each tuple represents a different permutation of the original tuple.\n   - The solution involves grouping tuples with the same permutation order together.\n\n2. **Reasoning:**\n   - The key to solving this problem is to analyze the input tuples and identify patterns or relationships between them.\n   - By examining the input tuples, we can observe that they have the following characteristics:\n     - They are all tuples of the same length.\n     - They have a unique permutation order within the tuple.\n     - They are grouped together if they have the same permutation order.\n\n3. **Solution:**\n   - The solution involves grouping the input tuples based on their permutation order.\n   - This can be achieved using a sorting algorithm, such as Merge Sort or Quick Sort.\n   - The output list will contain tuples in the same permutation order as the input list.\n\n4. **Test Case:**\n   - The test case provides input tuples, and the solution is calculated based on the logic described above.\n   - The output matches the expected output, confirming that the solution is correct.```\n\nUse these opinions carefully as additional advice and provide an updated reasoning and answer.
